# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer Project

## 🖼️ Overview

This project explores Neural Style Transfer (NST), a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to create stunning digital art. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub, leveraging a pre-trained model to apply artistic styles to user-provided images.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand and implement Neural Style Transfer using deep learning techniques. By the end of the project, we aim to provide a simple tool that can take any content image and style image to produce a new image that merges the two, combining the content of one with the artistic style of the other.

## 📝 Summary of Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is a technique that takes two images — a "content image" and a "style image" — and blends them so that the resulting output image retains the core elements of the content image, but appears to be “painted” in the style of the style reference image. This is achieved using a deep neural network, typically with a pre-trained convolutional network like VGG19 to extract features from the images.

The model optimizes two key loss functions:

- **Content Loss**: Ensures that the output image retains the core content of the content image.
- **Style Loss**: Ensures that the output image adopts the style patterns from the style image.

## 👨‍💻 Implementation

In this project, we use TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to load a pre-trained neural style transfer model. The steps involved are:

1. **Load and preprocess the images**: The content and style images are loaded and prepared for input to the model.
2. **Apply the style transfer**: The pre-trained model combines the content of the first image with the style of the second image.
3. **Display and save the output**: The stylized image is displayed and saved for later use.
